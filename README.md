# Quantum Time Domain Signal Processing

I have developed a theory for signal-processing artifacts of quantum time. Quantum time is a property of consciousness spiraling into relative time using a 2D time model. This is a consequence of the eternal (outside of time) divine nature of life and its entanglement in the material world.

The signal artifacts look just like noise, but they are not. With the appropriate DSP, they are mappable onto detectable signals. Such an algorithm could provide the long-sought *way in* that skips all of the esoterica. The digital "Philosopher's Stone" of alchemy.

## The paper

"Quantum Time Signals in Living Beings" is a paper that I wrote to explore algorithms for implementing QTDSP codecs.

It's in TeX format, perfect for repositories like Github. This is truly Open Science. If you want to add to the paper or make corrections, you can create a branch and generate a pull request. Welcome to the next step in human evolution.

## Other work

I'm implementing a codec in VHDL. Licensing options to be determined. Most likely a dual-licensing model.
