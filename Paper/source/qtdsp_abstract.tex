Consciousness is considered a physical process occuring inside and outside of time simultaneously,
per spiritual traditions and recent scientific advances,
using two-dimensional time.
Quantum time emerges from consciousness as it interacts with both worlds.
The relationship between the time dimensions provides a mechanism for apparent
noise arising from both our biological signaling and connection to divinity.
We present an algorithm for the demodulation of white and pink noise,
which can have ``hidden'' information content that instruments the
mind-body landscape.
The demodulated signals facilitate a new class of consciousness applications.
The detection and analysis of these signals, or instrumenting the soul,
has far-reaching implications for social structures, relationships, and public health.
