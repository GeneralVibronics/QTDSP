\section{Summary}

Signals that appear to be pure noise may contain hidden signals regarding non-local consciousness.
These signals could be analyzed to ``instrument the soul''.
Follow-up work to be done includes:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Write a graphical spectrum analyzer application using a GPU, FPGA or ASIC.
	\item Analyze existing experimental data to search for new signals.
	\item Develop new sensor technologies using quantum and spin effects.
\end{itemize}

The social impetus for such work is to repair the dysfunction introduced by
new technologies such as social media and pseudo-anonymous communications.
Instrumenting the soul would provide a new way of interacting that is completely open and honest.
Solving the trust problem would be a boon to economies across the globe.
