Everything is one. This is a holographic-like principle.

EEG and ECG data should contain consciousness signals.

For consciousness detection, a PIN photodiode may have its dark current
amplified and digitized. The BPW34 is a popular photodiode whose dark current
has been studied.
Bayhan and {\"O}zden \cite{Moreva} propose that tunneling enhanced
recombination plays a significant role in the dark forward current.
Since consciousness \cite{Xin} has been found to be able to modulate the
rate of radioactive decay (a tunneling phenomenon),
dark current is a good candidate for the measurement of consciousness signals.

An interesting experiment would be to expose the photodiode to sunlight.
The sun has a radiance fluctuation with a 1/f power spectrum.
If the sun is conscious, this noise should contain consciousness signals.

A photodiode is a good tunnel-current based sensor because its surface
is free of aluminum. Aluminum is a reflector of "torsion waves"
