Consciousness is considered a physical process occuring inside and outside of time simultaneously,
per spiritual traditions and recent scientific advances,
using two-dimensional time.
Quantum time emerges from consciousness as it interacts with both worlds.
The relationship between the time dimensions provides a mechanism for apparent
noise arising from both our biological signaling and connection to divinity.
We present an algorithm for the demodulation of white and pink noise,
which can have discernible information content that instruments the
mind-body landscape.
The demodulated signals facilitate a new class of consciousness applications.
The detection and analysis of these signals has far-reaching implications for 
determinism, free will, heritability, health, and human interconnectedness.
