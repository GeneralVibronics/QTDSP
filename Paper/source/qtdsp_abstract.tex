Consciousness is considered a physical process occuring inside and outside of time simultaneously,
per spiritual traditions and modern QM theory, using two-dimensional time.
Quantum time hypothetically emerges from non-local consciousness as it interacts with both worlds.
The relationship between the time dimensions provides a mechanism for apparent
noise arising from both our biological signaling and connection to ``divinity''.
We present an algorithm for the demodulation of white and pink noise,
which could have ``hidden'' information content that instruments the
mind-body landscape.
If found, the demodulated signals would facilitate a new class of consciousness applications.
The detection and analysis of these signals, or instrumenting the soul,
would have far-reaching implications for social structures, governance, and public health.
