# emergent
A theory of signal-processing emergent time. Emergent time is a property of consciousness spiraling into causal time. This is a consequence of the eternal (outside of time) nature of life and our entanglement in the material world.

The signal artifacts look just like noise, but they are not. With the appropriate DSP, they are mappable onto detectable signals. Such an algorithm would provide the long sought-after *way in* that skips all of the esoterica. The digital "Philosopher's stone".
