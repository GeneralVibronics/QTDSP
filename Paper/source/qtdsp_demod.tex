Multiple demodulator instances can be placed in an FPGA or ASIC to demodulate a
large number of $\omega$ values in parallel. This would be used in spectral
analysis, for finding signals; and deep data mining, for analyzing weak signals.
Due to the low I/O bandwidth, the algorithm lends itself to parallelism without
the complexity of high-speed signaling or memory management.
A low-cost ASIC would be feasible for consumer applications.

The mathematics of signal conversion, besides FFT, is College Algebra.
The algorithm can be coded by a typical programmer or engineer with some help
from the following derivations.

\subsection{Downsampling}

The downsampling process of Fig.~\ref{fig:demod} translates the sample pitch of
X to the sample pitch of Y using an exponential sweep.
In the industry, this is known as exponential time-warping.

An exponential chirp sweeps from $f_0$ to $f_1$ in a time T.
M points of X get mapped onto N points of Y, where $M > N$.
Let R be a scaled version of $\omega$ for use in the exponential warp and
$\alpha$ the X input sample rate in samples per second.
Given a particular R and N, M and $\omega$ may be calculated.
Let $\epsilon = (f_1/f_0)^{1/T}$. The frequency with respect to time is:
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:fvsf0}
f = f_0 \cdot e^{\epsilon t}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Math}

The period of the incoming chirp changes exponentially with index n of $X[n]$.
Let $y = e^{|R|/N}$ be the pitch that accumulates along X.
It has units of ``e's per sample''.
As a scale factor, let $\omega = \frac{\alpha R}{N}$,
in units of ``e's per second'' e/s.
M is the number of input samples warping onto N points.
To time-warp the input, let N be a sum of M segments whose size starts at 1 and
get compressed exponentially. 
The calculation of M starts with a geometric progression in Eq. \ref{eq:M_N0}.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:M_N0}
N = \sum_{k=1}^{M} e^{-|R| \cdot (k-1)/N} = \frac{1 - e^{-|R| \cdot M/N}}{1 - e^{-|R|/N}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:M_N}
M = \frac{-N}{|R|} \cdot\ ln\left( 1 - N(1-e^{-|R|/N}) \right)
\end{equation}

\begin{table}
	\label{tab:MNR}
	\caption{High values of M/N are undesirable because of excess processing
	time and memory usage.
    The point of diminishing returns for M/N is between 2 and 4.
    }
	\centering
	\begin{tabular}{lcr}
		\hline\hline
		$M/N$ & $Max |R|$ & $y_{max}:y_{min}$ \\ [0.5ex]
		\hline
		2 & 0.78 & 4.6:1\\
		4 & 0.96 & 46:1\\
		\hline
	\end{tabular}
\end{table}

An upper limit of 2 for M/N is reasonable from both a mathematical and
hardware standpoint. For example, if M is constrained to 2N, N=1024, and
$\alpha$ = 10000 samples/second, then $|\omega|$ ranges between 0 and 12.26 e/s
($0 < |R| < 0.78$).
When fixed-sized memories are used, smaller N allows for larger M/N, larger R,
and higher $\omega$ per input sample rate.

Re-sampling is done on N points (of Y) at a time where the respective indices of
X and Y are $\delta$ and i.
The time span is from 0 to i/N where i sweeps from 0 to N-1 and N is the number
of samples.
Let $\lambda$ be the sample pitch of X.
It will increase or decrease exponentially and should have a minimum value of
1.0, but allowed a minimum value of less than one to allow for rounding error.

This causes a chirp of matching R to be re-sampled to the upper frequency
(either $f_0$ or $f_1$ depending on the sign of R).
Given output index i, input sample index $\delta(i)$ is the accumulated sum of
$\lambda(i)$ when $\lambda$ starts at 1.0 and increases exponentially
or starts at $e^{M \cdot R/N}$ and decreases exponentially.
The exponential sweep can be implemented with a multiplier.
For each step:
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:lambda}
\lambda = \lambda + (\lambda\cdot\Lambda)
\end{equation}

The initial value of $\lambda$ is $e^{M \cdot R/N}$ when $R>0$; otherwise, it's 1.
The ``repeated multiply'' approach to exponential sweep is nearly base $e$,
but it needs a small correction factor to hit $e$.
Setting $e^R = (1 + \Lambda)^N$,
\begin{equation}  \label{eq:lambdaApprox}
\Lambda = e^{R/N} - 1
\end{equation}

As a sanity check, a downward-chirping sine wave was generated using a phase
angle proportional to $e^{n\cdot R/N} - 1$ with index $n$ starting from 0.
$\Lambda$ was set to $e^{R/N} - 1$, where $R=-0.5$ and $N=1024$.
An FFT (with Hann window) was performed on the de-chirped wave to
produce the expected narrow peak. 
The warping process also generates a noise floor about 30 dBm below the peak
as seen in Fig. \ref{fig:UdnSpec}.
Lower N generates more noise.
In Fig. \ref{fig:UupSpec}, $F_0$ is 0.95 of $F_S/2$, so the warped chirp is
mostly above $F_S/2$. It aliases to a non-exponential chirp that gets
smeared across the noise floor.
The $F_0=0.4F_S/2$ trace is upconverted to $0.8F_S/2$ at about
20 dB above the noise floor.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Downsampling}

The i index is stepped from 0 to N-1, where N is a power of 2 (although it
doesn't have to be) for the convenience of the FFT. $\delta(i)$ sweeps
non-linearly from 0 to M. For each X, its index $\delta$ is the running sum
of $\lambda$. For each Y point, the downsampler averages one or more X points.

The most common downsampling method is a low pass filter whose output is
sampled less often than its input rate.
This method attenuates alias frequencies before they make it to the output.
Alias peaks don't correlate, but they do produce noise artifacts.
A biquad LPF is a good choice of filter because it uses coefficients that
can be stored in a table or computed in hardware.
The loss of endpoints due to the filter delay is not a problem.
The endpoints of the filtered X are allowed some slop,
as the Hann window will lop them off anyway.

Fractional interpolation sums $\lambda$ input samples of X.
This works without a filter so it's fast but noisy.
Some fractional arithmetic is required to handle partial contributions.
Fig.~\ref{fig:xint} illustrates a simple interpolation that adds two fractional
endpoints to 0 or more midpoints for downsampling.
$k$ is the integer part of $\delta$.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{../source/xint_e}
	\caption[X interpolation]{Sum of $X_\delta$ for downsampling}
	\label{fig:xint}
\end{figure}

In either case, the output of the downsampler could be scaled by
$s=\sqrt{1/\lambda}$ to flatten the noise floor.
The Central Limit Theorem reduces noise
by the square root of the number of samples in a sum.
On the other hand, one might expect energy conservation to cause the
amplitude of the incoming signal to fall off with time spreading.
So, the scaling should be optional.
Another instance of exponential sweep, with $\Lambda_s = -\Lambda/2$
and $s_0 = e^{R/2N}$,
can produce this scale factor rather easily.

	\label{fig:xbuf}
\end{figure}

Oversampling would normally use a sliding window on a circular buffer sized as
a power of two to allow pointer wrapping by bitwise-and.
Fig.~\ref{fig:xbuf} shows the memory layout of $X$.
After a block of processing, $\alpha\Delta$ input samples are concatenated to
$X$ and the index of $X_0$ is offset by $\alpha\Delta$,
where $\Delta$ is the time interval of the blocks.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{FFT}

After X is time warped into Y, Y is processed by a Fast Fourier Transform and
converted to data set U containing N/2 frequency bins. Y and U may share the
same physical memory if the FFT is performed in place.
The output of the FFT is converted to the square of the magnitude,
so square root is not needed.

A pipelined FFT can be used so that the FFT isn't the bottleneck.
Throughput is then limited by downsampling, which when done in hardware
processes one $X$ sample per clock cycle.
This strategy offers the best performance in an ASIC implementation.

A Hann window $w(n)$ is applied to Y before performing the FFT.
\begin{equation}
w(n) = \frac{1}{2}\left(1 - cos\left( \frac{2\pi n}{N-1} \right)\right)
\end{equation}

A DIT FFT is the usual choice for RFFT since bit reversal is easier at the input.
With an RFFT, you get twice the outputs given real-only input.
Adjacent input samples are grouped as pairs, with even samples as real and odd
samples as imaginary components of the complex input points.
After a CFFT is performed, a separation step doubles the output size.
Our experience is that the precision of the separation step degrades with small N
(maybe we did it wrong), so a simple CFFT (with zeroed imaginary part)
may be preferable in cases of small N.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Upsampling}

U is upsampled to form time-domain signal V.
Let $\epsilon$ and j be the respective indices of U and V.
For every index $\epsilon$ of U, the corresponding frequency can be normalized
to a fraction $(\gamma)$ of $Fs/2$.

It's much easier to work in terms of exponents than logs,
so the preferred re-mapping (another exponential time-warping operation)
extracts $U[\epsilon]$ from a linear progression of $V[j]$.
Warp indexing uses the relation:
\begin{equation}
\epsilon = \left(\frac{N}{2}-1\right) e^{\omega(t - \tau)}
\end{equation}

Time t (scaled to match the output stream's sample rate) sweeps from $\tau$
in the opposite direction of R's sign,
causing the exponent to start at 1 and decay downward.

Up-sampling $U[\epsilon]$ to $V[j]$ can't use the popular interpolation scheme
(zero stuffing) because the interpolation factor must be irrational. Instead,
partial contributions to $V[j]$ are extracted from one or two U points by
interpolation.

$j$ sweeps downward from $\gamma(N/2-1)$.
Index $\epsilon(j)$ is independent of R.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:eps_j}
\epsilon(j) = \gamma \left(\frac{N}{2}-1\right) e^{-kj/N}
\end{equation}

The desired difference between $\epsilon(0)$ and $\epsilon(1)$ in
Eq. \ref{eq:eps_j} is $1$. $\epsilon(0) = \gamma(N/2 - 1)$.

\begin{equation}
\epsilon(1) = \gamma(N/2 - 1) - 1 = \gamma(N/2 - 1) e^{-k/N}
\end{equation}

This gives a $k$ of approximately $2$. The exact value is:

\begin{equation}
k = N \cdot ln \left( \frac{N-2}{N-2-(2/\gamma)} \right)
\end{equation}

As a sanity check of Eq. \ref{eq:eps_j}, $\epsilon(j)$ starts at (N/2-1) which
points to the highest frequency element of the FFT result.
It decays toward 0 but will never get there.
The number of elements in W memory is slightly less than N/2 to allow some I/O
headroom. Due to the limited size of W memory,
the lowest frequency is about $(1/e)$ of the highest frequency,
leaving the lower $\approx37$\% of the spectrum unused.

The exponential decay of $\epsilon$ can be handled by repeated multiplication,
one per $U[\epsilon]$ fetch.
The exponential sweep needs a small correction factor to have a base of exactly
$e$.
%\frac{N}{2} \cdot (1 - e^{-k})
Setting $e^{-k} = (1 + \zeta)^{N}$,
\begin{equation}
\zeta = e^{k/N} - 1
\end{equation}

Let $H_X$ be the integer number of new X samples ($\gamma$) per conversion.

Let $H_V$ be the real number of output samples per conversion.

\begin{equation}  \label{eq:hv}
H_V = H_X \cdot \frac{|R|}{k}
\end{equation}

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.95\linewidth]{../source/uint_e}
	\caption[U interpolation]{Extraction of $U_\epsilon$}
	\label{fig:uint}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:uint} shows upsampling of U to V. It uses linear interpolation to
construct a curve to extract from.
In this case, the upsampler input pitch is less than 1.0 samples.
The height of $U_\epsilon$ is interpolated and multiplied by the pitch to get
the area under the curve, to be added to V[j].
The operation is similar to the "$\lambda < 1$" case of downsampling,
so the same hardware can support downsampling and upsampling.

Since $\epsilon$ is always positive, the upchirp case of $R>0$ needs to have its
j index mirrored by using V[v-j], where v is the maximum j such as (15/32)N.
The upsampler output is added to V memory as described below, indexed from the
top or bottom of the active region of V.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Correlation}

Warped U is added to output buffer V by RMS summation,
staggered in time (by $H_V$ samples) for each processing block.
When the downsampler's R value matches the chirp rate of an incoming chirp,
multiple peaks in the warped FFT output correlate in the output stream to
produce a corresponding output pulse in the V stream.
A more complex signal such as overlapping and/or modulated chirps will produce
pulse trains and/or modulation envelopes in the V stream.

\begin{figure}
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width=0.99\linewidth]{../source/wbuf_e}
	\caption[W correlation]{Correlation of V}
	\label{fig:wbuf}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:wbuf} shows the output correlator, another view of buffer V.
The output stream flows from left to right,
being initialized to 0 outside the accumulation region.
After $U_\epsilon$ is added to V, the $V_0$ index moves $H_V$ points
to the left, leaving $H_V$ newly minted output points.

Elements of V are accumulated squares of magnitudes.
An attempt was made to accumulate vectors,
with the idea that the phase rotations might sync up,
but it didn't work in simulation.
So, angle data from the FFT is discarded.
