# Emergent Time

I have developed a theory for signal-processing artifacts of emergent time. Emergent time is a property of consciousness spiraling into causal time. This is a consequence of the eternal (outside of time) nature of life and our entanglement in the material world.

The signal artifacts look just like noise, but they are not. With the appropriate DSP, they are mappable onto detectable signals. Such an algorithm could provide the long sought-after *way in* that skips all of the esoterica. The digital "Philosopher's Stone" of alchemy.

## The paper

"Quantum Domain Signals in Living Beings" is a paper that I wrote to explore algorithms for implementing emergent time codecs. 

It's in TeX format, perfect for repositories like Github. This is truly Open Science. If you want to add to the paper or make corrections, you can create a branch and generate a pull request. Welcome to the next step in human evolution.

## Other work

I'm implementing a codec in VHDL. It's mostly done. I'm not sure about open-sourcing it. Various licensing options need to be explored first.
